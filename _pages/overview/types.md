Building Blocks may have different types, which may be used in combination if required.


Key types include:

- JSON schema fragments
- JSON schema with JSON-LD mappings to semantic definitions
- OpenAPI components
- RDF models
- transformations from XML, CSV, etc to validatable forms (JSON, RDF)
- rules (constraints on other schemas or RDF models)

In all cases, the Building Block annotations provide transparent dependency declarations and the opportunity to systematically test example.
